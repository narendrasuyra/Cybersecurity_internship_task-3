🔒 This project focused on performing a full vulnerability scan on the local system using Nessus Essentials. The following key steps were carried out to complete the assessment:

🛠️ Steps Performed:
📥 Installed Nessus Essentials and completed initial setup.

🖥️ Configured the scan target using the local machine IP (localhost).

🚀 Launched a full vulnerability scan and monitored its progress.

📊 Reviewed detailed scan results after completion (~30–60 mins).

🔍 Identified vulnerabilities by severity: Info, Low, Medium, High, Critical.

🛡️ Researched potential fixes and mitigations for key issues.

📝 Documented critical vulnerabilities with descriptions and screenshots.

📌 Key Takeaways:
✅ Vulnerability scanning is essential for identifying security risks in real-time.

🧠 The scan helped understand how attackers might exploit unpatched or misconfigured systems.

🔧 Applying even basic fixes can significantly reduce risk exposure.

🖼️ Screenshots and documentation help in tracking security posture over time.

🔐 Final Thoughts:
Regular vulnerability assessments using tools like Nessus Essentials should be part of every system hardening and cybersecurity process. This hands-on project reinforces the value of proactive security monitoring, early risk detection, and continuous improvement to protect systems from evolving threats.
